#+TITLE: Doom Alabaster

Port of [[https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster][Alabaster Dark]] to [[https://doomemacs.org][Doom Emacs]].

* Alabaster's Motivation
Most color schemes highlight everything they can, ending up looking like a
fireworks show.

Instead, Alabaster uses minimal highlighting; it defines just four classes:

1. Strings
2. All statically known constants (numbers, symbols, keywords, boolean values)
3. Comments
4. Global definitions

Additionally:

- Alabaster does not highlight standard language keywords (if, else, function,
  etc). They are usually least important and most obvious part of any program.

- Alabaster highlights comments. Most schemes try to dim comments by using
  low-contrast greys. I think if code was complex enough that it deserved an
  explanation then it’s that explanation we should see and read first. It would
  be a crime to hide it.

- Alabaster doesn’t use font variations. It’s hard to scan code when it jumps
  between normal, bold and italics all the time. Also, not all fonts provide
  bold/italics variants.

- Having minimal amount of rules means you can consciously use them to look for
  the exact piece of information you need. Most other “fireworks” schemes
  provide only one meaningful contribution: if it’s colored it’s probably
  syntactically correct. Instead, in Alabaster you can actually remember all the
  rules, and e.g. if you need to look for a string you know that you’re looking
  for a green token. And all the strings really pop out because there are not
  many other things highlighted.

- Alabaster only highlights things that parser could identify reliably. I
  believe that if highlighting works only partially then it does more harm than
  good. When highlighting works reliably, your brain learns to rely on it. When
  it’s not reliable, your brain spends precious brain cycles to re-check
  everything it sees on the screen.
